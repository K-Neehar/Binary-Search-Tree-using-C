# Binary-Search-Tree-using-C

The binary search algorithm is a widely used algorithm in the computational domain. It is a simple, reliable, and efficient search algorithm that can work well on both big and small datasets. BSTs are used for a lot of applications due to its ordered structure. 
BSTs are used for indexing and multi-level indexing. They are also helpful to implement various searching algorithms. It is helpful in maintaining a sorted stream of data. TreeMap and TreeSet data structures are internally implemented using self-balancing BSTs.
